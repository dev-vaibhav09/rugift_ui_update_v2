                Rugift takes the privacy and protection of personal information for you and your family members very seriously. By visiting the Site and/or using the Rugift Services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy“). Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms shall have the meanings assigned to such terms set forth in the Rugift Terms of Use which incorporates this Privacy Policy by reference.<br><br>

                <b class="d-block mb-2">What This Privacy Policy Covers</b><br><br> <!-- d-block for display block  -->

                This Privacy Policy describes Rugift’s use of Personal Information and Anonymous Information that we collect when you use our Rugift Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the use of your Personal Information that is collected by third parties that Rugift does not own or control.
                <br><br>
                “Personal Information” is information that is personally identifiable like names, addresses, e-mail addresses, or phone numbers, as well as other non-public information that is associated with the foregoing. Personal Information may include information that is personally identifiable information as defined by applicable law.
                <br><br>
                “Anonymous Information” means information that is not Personal Information; Anonymous Information does not, itself, identify individual persons.
                <br><br>
                We collect and use Personal Information and Anonymous Information as described in this Privacy Policy from the visitors of our Site, and from Users.
                <br><br>
                By using the Rugift Services or submitting Personal Information through our Rugift Services, you expressly consent to the processing of your Personal Information according to this Privacy Policy.
                <br><br>
                Your Personal Information may be processed by us in the country where it was collected as well as other countries  where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in your country.
                <br><br>
                <b class="d-block mb-2">Personal Information We Collect</b>
                <br><br>
                We collect the following Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily:
                <br><br>
                Our Account registration process requires you to provide Rugift with a valid e-mail address as well as a Sign-In name and password of your choice. If you want to use some of the mobile features of the Rugift Services, we will collect your mobile phone number.
                In order to receive payments you make to use the Rugift Services, we collect the information necessary to charge your card, including your full name, zip code, country of residence and credit card number.
                When you contact us by sending us an e-mail, text message, or when you use any of our contact forms, we will collect any information that is contained in your e-mail, text message, or that you enter such forms.
                Personal Information Collected Via Technology
                <br><br>
                As you use the Rugift Services, certain information may also be collected passively, including your Internet protocol (IP) address and the browser that you use to visit the Site. The Services create a log file of the IP addresses of the visitors and Users of the Services. Rugift also stores a small text file called a “Cookie” on your computer to store your login information and your personal preferences for the Rugift Services. Rugift may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them). While you will still be able to use the Services if you disable Cookies in your browser, certain parts of the Services may not function as effectively. You must have Cookies enabled in your web browser to use the Rugift Services. When you send us a text message, we collect the mobile phone number from which you sent us such text message.
                <br><br>
                Since the foregoing information may be collected when you are signed into the Rugift Services as a User, this information may be associated by us with Personal Information that we have collected from you.
                <br><br>
                <b class="d-block mb-2">Personal Information Collected From Other Sources</b>
                <br><br>
                We may receive Personal Information about you from other sources like telephone or fax, or from third parties that provide services for us in connection with the Rugift Services. We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via our Rugift Services.
                <br><br>
                <b class="d-block mb-2">Use Of Information We Collect</b>

                <br><br>
                Please note that the information you provide to the Rugift Services may be accessible by other Users that are using the same Family Account, depending on the setting of this Family Account and your status within such Family Account.

We may use this Anonymous Information for internal purposes, such as analyzing usage patterns so that we may enhance our Rugift Services, and we also reserve the right to use and disclose any Anonymous Information at our discretion.
                <br><br>
                <b class="d-block mb-2">Feedback</b>
                <br><br>

These service providers may have the same rights to disclose such information as Rugift has under this section “Disclosure of Personal Information”.
                <br><br>

You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Rugift or its assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
